# GitHub Setup Guide for MyBitcoinFuture Organization

**Purpose:** Complete setup guide for GitHub API access and organization optimization  
**Security:** Zero-commit approach - no secrets or tokens in repositories  
**Scope:** Build monitoring, organization management, and GitHub Teams optimization

## 🚨 CRITICAL: Security-First Approach

**⚠️ NEVER commit tokens, secrets, or API keys to repositories**

This guide ensures all sensitive data is managed through environment variables and secure practices.

## Phase 1: GitHub Personal Access Token Setup

### Step 1: Create GitHub Personal Access Token

1. **Navigate to GitHub Settings:**
   - Go to GitHub.com → Your profile → Settings
   - Click "Developer settings" in the left sidebar
   - Click "Personal access tokens" → "Tokens (classic)"

2. **Generate New Token:**
   - Click "Generate new token" → "Generate new token (classic)"
   - Set token description: `MyBitcoinFuture Organization Management`
   - Set expiration: `1 year`

3. **Select Required Permissions:**
   ```
   ✅ repo (Full control of private repositories)
   ✅ admin:org (Full control of orgs and teams, read and write org projects)
   ✅ admin:public_key (Full control of user public keys)
   ✅ admin:repo_hook (Full control of repository hooks)
   ✅ admin:org_hook (Full control of organization hooks)
   ✅ workflow (Update GitHub Action workflows)
   ✅ write:discussion (Write access to team discussions)
   ✅ read:user (Read access to user profile information)
   ✅ read:project (Read access to projects)
   ```

4. **Generate and Save Token:**
   - Click "Generate token"
   - **IMPORTANT:** Copy the token immediately - you won't see it again
   - Save it securely (password manager recommended)

### Step 2: Set Up Token Environment Variable

**Option A: Session-Only (Recommended for testing)**
```bash
# Set token for current session only
export GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_your_token_here

# Verify token is set
echo $GITHUB_TOKEN | head -c 10
```

**Option B: Persistent (Recommended for development)**
```bash
# Add to shell profile for persistence
echo 'export GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_your_token_here' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

# Verify token is set
echo $GITHUB_TOKEN | head -c 10
```

**Option C: Project-Specific (Recommended for production)**
```bash
# Create .env file (will be gitignored)
echo "GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_your_token_here" > .env

# Add to .gitignore if not already there
echo ".env" >> .gitignore
```

### Step 3: Verify Token Access

```bash
# Test token access
node scripts/test-github-access.js

# Expected output:
# ✅ GITHUB_TOKEN is set
# ✅ Rate limit info: 5000/5000
# ✅ Authentication successful
# ✅ Repository access verified
```

## Phase 2: Build Monitoring Setup

### Step 1: Test Build Monitoring

```bash
# Test with public repository (no token required)
./scripts/build-status.sh website

# Test with private repository (token required)
./scripts/build-status.sh dashboard

# Test all repositories
./scripts/build-status.sh all

# Test watch mode
./scripts/build-status.sh --watch --interval 30
```

### Step 2: Verify Build Monitoring Features

**Table Format (Default):**
```bash
./scripts/build-status.sh dashboard --format table
```

**Summary Format:**
```bash
./scripts/build-status.sh dashboard --format summary
```

**JSON Format (for automation):**
```bash
./scripts/build-status.sh dashboard --format json
```

**Watch Mode (continuous monitoring):**
```bash
./scripts/build-status.sh --watch --interval 60
```

## Phase 3: Organization Management Setup

### Step 1: Audit Current Organization State

```bash
# Audit current organization configuration
node scripts/github-org-manager.js audit

# Expected output shows:
# - Organization information
# - Current teams
# - Current repositories
# - Current projects
```

### Step 2: Set Up Recommended Team Structure

```bash
# Set up recommended teams
node scripts/github-org-manager.js setup-teams

# This creates:
# - core-development (admin access)
# - partners (limited access)
# - beta-testers (read access)
# - community-contributors (PR access)
# - advisory (read access)
```

### Step 3: Configure Repository Settings

```bash
# Configure repository settings
node scripts/github-org-manager.js setup-repositories

# This configures:
# - Professional descriptions
# - Topics and tags
# - Branch protection rules
# - Merge settings
```

### Step 4: Create Project Boards

```bash
# Create project boards
node scripts/github-org-manager.js setup-projects

# This creates:
# - marketplace-launch-pipeline
# - plugin-development-roadmap
# - partnership-coordination
# - community-management
```

### Step 5: Validate Configuration

```bash
# Validate all configurations
node scripts/github-org-manager.js validate

# Generate comprehensive report
node scripts/github-org-manager.js report
```

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Token Access Issues:**
```bash

echo $GITHUB_TOKEN | head -c 10

# Test token access
node scripts/test-github-access.js

# Regenerate token if needed
# Go to GitHub Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens
```

**Rate Limit Issues:**
```bash
# Check rate limit
node scripts/test-github-access.js

# Wait for reset or use authenticated access
# Rate limits: 60/hour (unauthenticated) vs 5000/hour (authenticated)
```

**Repository Access Issues:**
```bash
# Check repository visibility
node scripts/test-github-access.js

# Verify token permissions
# Ensure token has 'repo' scope for private repositories
```

**Permission Issues:**
```bash
