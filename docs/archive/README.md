- `ai-guidelines-archive.md` - Duplicate of main AI guidelines (see [AI_GUIDELINES.md](../AI_GUIDELINES.md))

## üîÑ Why Archived?

### **Migration Documents**
These documents were created during the transition from placeholder "MBFBTC" to "MyBitcoinFuture Treasury Management System". They contain historical context but are no longer relevant for current development.

### **Redundant Documentation**
Some documents were duplicated across repositories or contained outdated information. The current documentation structure consolidates this information into focused, up-to-date guides.

## üìö Current Documentation

- **[Main Documentation Index](../README.md)** - Essential documentation
